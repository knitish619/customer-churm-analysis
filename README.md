# customer-churm-analysis

Customer churn analysis is the process of evaluating and understanding customer behavior to predict and mitigate customer churn. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or stop using its products or services. Understanding why customers churn is crucial for businesses, as it allows them to identify potential issues, make improvements, and implement strategies to retain customers.

This repository contains code and resources for performing customer churn analysis. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to approach churn analysis and develop models that can accurately predict customer churn. The analysis involves various steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and visualization of results.

# Key Features
Data preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables to make them suitable for analysis.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Provides insights into customer behavior by visualizing and summarizing key metrics, such as churn rate, customer demographics, and usage patterns.
Feature engineering: Involves creating new features from the existing data to improve the predictive power of machine learning models.
Model training and evaluation: Demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict customer churn. The models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques like cross-validation.
Visualization: Utilizes data visualization techniques to present the results of churn analysis in a clear and understandable manner.
